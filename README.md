# GY-MCU90640-RPI-Python
The script to connect the thermal image module GY-MCU90640 to Raspberry Pi.

![Alt text](https://github.com/vvkuryshev/GY-MCU90640-RPI-Python/blob/master/Termovision_github.jpg?raw=true "Title")
The module GY-MCU90640 is based on a MLX90640 sensor, but additionally contains a microcontroller STM32F103 to simplify working with MLX90640.

The protocol of interaction with the module is shown in the file "GY_MCU9064 user manual v1.pdf". I apologize for the quality of the translation, this is an automatic translation from Chinese into English with the Google Translator.

The resulting images and the scheme of connection the module with the Raspberry Pi are shown in the image above. The main.py script is tested for RPI 3 B + and RPI Zero W.

The description of connection process is on https://habr.com/ru/post/441050/ (or https://habr.com/ru/post/435946/, if you are reading in Russian)
